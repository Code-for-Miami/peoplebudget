# PeopleBudget

PeopleBudget is an interactive mobile-first web application. PeopleBudget is focused on launching
local budget initiatives starting with "Miami Budget" for the City of Miami. For decades Cities release
data related to budgets but usually in the form of a PDF document. We seek to create engaging and informative ways to get people informed in the budgetary process. This project was inspired by "Austin Budget Party" a project funded by Mozilla with the City of Austin. This is not a fork and redeploy of that but a continued works of the orginal concept.
